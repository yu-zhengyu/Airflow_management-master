# Airflow_management-master
This is the course research project about CMU 18779
We use Genetic Algorithm, Genetic programming and Evolutionary Algorithm to simulate the AirFlow managenment and find the opt solution.

## There code is for the final project in Stochastic Optimization.  

Here is the list of information about some part of important source code file.
main.cpp ---- The main function is in this file. you can run it directly;

EA.h and EA.cpp ---- All main functions about Genetic Algorithm;

ES.h and ES.cpp ---- All main functions about Evolutionary Strategy; 

EP.h and EP.cpp ---- All main functions about Evolutionary Programming; 

data.txt ---- Raw data which collect from China Airline.

## Here is the [Final Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxkScJRnmpRqaHRuRnFVdzE1a1U/view?usp=sharing)
